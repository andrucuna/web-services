To generate client stubs:

1.) Be sure the JAX-WS web service is deployed and runing, try testing the wsdl
	defined in 'helloservice' at: http://localhost:8080/helloservice/HelloService
	in a web browser.
	
2.) Open a terminal and run command:
	cd /%pathhome%/src
	pointing your client's src folder
	
3.) Run command:
	wsimport -s . http://localhost:8080/helloservice/HelloService
	
	
Client stubs must be generated! Have fun :3!
